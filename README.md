# BUS ROUTE OPTIMISER

## Background
The idea behind this project was one of the most commonly faced problems by me and many of my fellow college mates which is lack of knowledge about bus stops and routes in Guwahati City. 

I have created this simple Web App to find the shortest and most optimal sequence of bus routes that one should take to reach to their desired location in Guwahati City. 
The App uses **Djikstra's Alogrithm** to find the shortest route.

All bus routes information was taken from the official webiste of [ASTC](https://astc.assam.gov.in/)
